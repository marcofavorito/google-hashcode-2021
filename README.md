# google-hashcode-YYYY

A framework to participate in the Google Hash Code contest.

## TL;DR

When the problem specifications will be announced:

- Put the input problems in `data/` as `.in` files;
- Implement the stubs in `hashcode/common/base.py`
- Put your solutions as Python modules in `hashcode/solutions` (one module  for each solution).
- Run `scripts/run.sh` to produce:
  - output files in `outputs/`
  - `solution.zip` to submit.
  - a `SUBMISSION` file that contains details on the solutions found.

## Usage

- Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/marcofavorito/google-hashcode-YYYY.git
```

- Create the virtual environment. It requires [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
```
pipenv shell --python=python3.7
```

- Install the dependencies and the package:
```
pipenv install --dev
pip install -e .
```

- Usage of the main entrypoint:
```
python -m hashcode --alg ${ALGORITHM} < input_file > output_file
```
      
It expects input in `stdin` and prints output in `stdout`.

- To compute the solutions for every data in `data/*.in`:
```
./scripts/run.sh ${ALGORITHM}
```
      
Details about the submission in the `SUBMISSION` file, generated by the `run.sh` script.
It will provide details about the chosen algorithm `alg`, which will correspond to the
module::function `hashcode/sol/${alg}::main`

## Linters

The `Makefile` provides several commands to run linters and code formatters.

The most useful command is `make lint-all`:
```
make lint-all
```

It will run `black`, `isort`, and other lint checkers 
like `flake8` and `mypy` after that.

You can also run them separately:
```
make black
make isort
make flake8
make static
make bandit
make safety
make vulture
make pylint
```
